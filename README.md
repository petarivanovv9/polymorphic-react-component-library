## Technologies

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Storybook

## Key points:

### Badge as an `a tag`?

We can do that through Polymorphism. Polymorphism stands for "multiple forms". In our case, we want to render the Badge into multiple forms - `a tag`, `div`, etc.

We can do that with:

- **`as` prop** - allows us to replace rendered HTML elements in a React component from the outside by passing them in as props

- **TypeScript** - to define the needed types and allowed props based on the `as` prop

### Styling?

- `Theme Provider` => cleaner templates

## Good Practices:

- Multiple props over Single - use multiple props for defining the outlook of a component
- Documentation + Examples
